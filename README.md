## Zero Browser ##
Opinionated, simple and clean android browser based on webview. Minimal footprint. 

*based on* [this repository](https://github.com/badener95/Companion-Browser)

**Zero address bar** Most android users search and navigate to their favorite website from the search result page. Therefore, we have included a shortcut to Google search.\
**Zero favorites** Difficult to implement and minimal benefits\
**Zero tabs** We use Windows instead as separate app instances\
**Zero tracking** This app does not spy on users (no metrics, no analytics)\
**Zero notifications** Noone will miss it\
**Zero ad-blocking** Creators and developers must make a living somehow\
**Zero in app ads**\
**Zero in app prompts for rating, permissions etc** If you want to star us do so, we want some spontaneous love. If you want to use camera / microphone you can easily allow that\
**No geolocation and file access** Safety first! 

Menu : Search, Refresh, Open new window, Share, Add shortcut, Clear browsing data, Set custom Startpage, Dark - Light mode switch, Give cam/mic permission, Open page in default browser (sniff.. my big brother is stronger than me..), Close window 

Zero wants to be the best second android browser, not the second best one.
