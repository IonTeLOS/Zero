## Zero Browser ##
Opinionated, simple and lightweight android browser based on webview.

*based on* [this repository](https://github.com/badener95/Companion-Browser)

**Zero address bar** Most android users search and navigate to their favorite website from the search result page. Therefore, we have included a shortcut to Google search.\
**Zero favorites** Difficult to implement and minimal benefits\
**Zero tabs** We use Windows instead as separate app instances\
**Zero tracking** This app does not spy on users (no metrics, no analytics)\
**Zero notifications** Noone will miss it\
**Zero ad-blocking** Creators and developers must make a living somehow\
**Zero in app ads**\
**Zero in app prompts for rating, permissions etc** If you want to star us do so, we want some spontaneous love. If you want to use camera / microphone you can easily allow that\
**No geolocation and file access** Safety first! \

Menu : Search, Refresh, Open new window, Share, Add shortcut, Clear browsing data, Set custom Startpage, Dark - Light mode switch, Give cam/mic permission, Open page in default browser (sniff.. my big brother is stronger than me..), Close window
